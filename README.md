## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neotopia-web-app.git
cd neotopia-web-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
